# Changing-Letters-Shrink-to-Logo

Code to make a letter changing Pre-Loader/Loader which eventually turns into a logo. You can customize the letters from the JS file, "Var Letters". 
To reduce timeout and delay and fade in, Go to the js file and change the timeouts. 
To customize after loaded logo, Go to "#box.one" and customize per need.
To increase/decrease the letter changing time go to JS file and change "$timer".

Thank You for using my code.
